    'What brings you to the emergency department today? I have this terrible headache. It came on suddenly about two hours ago. It\'s the worst headache I\'ve ever had. Can you describe the headache? What does it feel like? It\'s like an explosion in my head. It started at the back of my head and neck. The pain is unbearable. Have you experienced anything like this before? No, never. This is completely new and terrifying. Have you noticed any other symptoms? Yes, my neck feels really stiff, and bright lights are bothering my eyes. I also feel a bit nauseous. Have you had any loss of consciousness or confusion? I didn\'t lose consciousness, but I feel a bit out of it. Everything seems foggy. Any recent trauma or injury to your head? No, nothing like that. It just came out of nowhere. Do you have any significant past medical history? I have high blood pressure. I take medication for it, but I\'m not sure if I\'ve been taking it regularly. Any family history of aneurysms or strokes? My mother had a stroke when she was in her sixties. Are you currently taking any medications? Just the blood pressure medication. I can\'t remember the name right now. Have you been experiencing any fever or recent illness? No fever, and I haven\'t been sick recently. Given your symptoms, we need to act quickly. The sudden onset of the worst headache of your life, along with neck stiffness and photophobia, raises concern for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is bleeding in the space around the brain. This is a medical emergency. What does that mean? What\'s going to happen? We\'re going to start by doing a CT scan of your head to look for any signs of bleeding. If the CT is positive, or if we\'re still concerned despite a negative CT, we may need to do a lumbar puncture to check for blood in the spinal fluid. Is this serious? Yes, it is very serious. If we confirm a subarachnoid hemorrhage, we\'ll need to admit you to the intensive care unit and involve a neurosurgeon. The bleeding is often caused by a ruptured aneurysm, which is a weak spot in a blood vessel. The neurosurgeon will discuss options like clipping the aneurysm or using a procedure called coiling to prevent further bleeding. What are the risks? Without treatment, there\'s a high risk of rebleeding, which can be fatal. Even with treatment, there can be complications like stroke, seizures, or long term neurological deficits. But prompt treatment significantly improves outcomes. The CT scan has just come back, and it shows blood in the subarachnoid space, confirming a subarachnoid hemorrhage. We\'re going to admit you to the ICU immediately and start medications to prevent complications. We\'ll also arrange for a cerebral angiography to identify the source of the bleeding, likely an aneurysm. The neurosurgeon will be involved in your care from here. What medications will I be given? We\'ll start you on a medication called nimodipine, which helps prevent a complication called vasospasm, where blood vessels in the brain narrow. We\'ll also closely monitor and control your blood pressure to prevent rebleeding while keeping enough blood flow to your brain. Will I need surgery? That will depend on what the angiography shows. If an aneurysm is identified, the neurosurgeon will discuss the best approach, whether it\'s surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. Both are aimed at sealing off the aneurysm to prevent further bleeding. How long will I be in the hospital? Recovery from a subarachnoid hemorrhage can take weeks to months. You\'ll likely be in the ICU for at least a week, and then you may need additional time in the hospital for rehabilitation. The exact timeline will depend on how you respond to treatment and whether there are any complications. I understand. This is a lot to take in. I know it\'s overwhelming, but you\'re in the right place. We\'re going to do everything we can to take care of you. Do you have any other questions right now? No, I think I just need to process this. Thank you. Of course. We\'ll keep you and your family informed every step of the way.',
    'Emergency Department Clinical Record\n\n\nPresenting Complaint:\n● Sudden onset severe headache (\"thunderclap headache\")\n\nDiagnosis:\n● Acute subarachnoid haemorrhage\n\nManagement Plan:\n● Immediate ICU admission\n● Nimodipine therapy for vasospasm prevention\n● Blood pressure management\n● Cerebral angiography to identify bleeding source\n● Neurosurgical consultation for aneurysm treatment (clipping or coiling)\n● Close neurological monitoring\n● Long-term rehabilitation planning\n\nPatient presents with sudden onset of severe headache described as \"worst headache of life\" occurring approximately 2 hours prior to presentation. Associated symptoms include neck stiffness, photophobia, and nausea. Patient denies loss of consciousness but reports feeling confused and \"foggy\". No recent head trauma. Patient has past medical history of hypertension with irregular medication compliance. Family history significant for maternal stroke in sixth decade. No recent febrile illness.\n\nCT head demonstrates blood in subarachnoid space confirming subarachnoid haemorrhage. Clinical presentation with thunderclap headache, meningismus, and photophobia consistent with SAH. Patient requires urgent neurosurgical evaluation and intensive care management.\n\nImmediate ICU admission arranged for close neurological monitoring and blood pressure management. Nimodipine commenced for vasospasm prophylaxis. Cerebral angiography scheduled to identify bleeding source, likely ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Neurosurgical team consulted regarding definitive aneurysm management via surgical clipping versus endovascular coiling. Blood pressure carefully titrated to prevent rebleeding while maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion. Patient and family counselled regarding serious nature of condition, treatment options, potential complications including rebleeding, vasospasm, stroke, seizures, and need for prolonged hospital stay with rehabilitation. Prognosis guarded but improved with prompt appropriate intervention.',
