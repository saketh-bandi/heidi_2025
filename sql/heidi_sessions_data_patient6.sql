    'So settle in. How have the last couple of weeks unfolded for you, Alex? Anything particularly standing out, good or bad? Unfolded. That\'s a good word. It feels tangled, maybe? Not disastrously so, just messy. It\'s been busy, which is part of it. Work has been absolutely relentless. We finally launched that big project I was dreading. You know, the Phoenix Initiative, they dramatically called it. Ah, yes. Phoenix. The one causing those late nights a few weeks back. How did the launch actually go? Technically, fine. Smooth even. Minimal glitches. Client seemed happy. My boss, Sarah, even gave me a sort of public nod in the team meeting, which was unexpected. But internally, it was like running a marathon I hadn\'t trained for and then being expected to immediately start planning the next one. I felt hollowed out afterwards, like, completely spent. And the nod from Sarah, it was weird. It felt performative, Or maybe I\'m just projecting because I felt like I was performing the whole time. Tell me more about that feeling of performing. What did that look like, feel like during the launch week? It was constant vigilance, making sure every email was perfectly worded, double checking everyone else\'s work without looking like I was micromanaging, anticipating problems that might not even exist, smiling through status meetings where I felt like screaming, saying, Yes, absolutely. I can get that to you by end of day, when my internal monologue was just a string of expletives. It was that old familiar feeling, the need to be the capable, unflappable one, the one who holds it all together so no one else has to worry, or worse, so no one gets annoyed at me. That resonates with what we\'ve explored before, That sense of responsibility for managing the emotional temperature of a room or a project in this case. Taking on the burden to prevent what? What\'s the feared outcome if you weren\'t that capable, unflappable one? Disappointment, I guess. Criticism. Someone thinking I\'m not up to the job, Sarah relying on me less, maybe even losing the respect of the team, or fundamentally just not being liked, not being seen as valuable. It sounds so basic when I say it out loud, but it feels huge in the moment. It feels like if I drop one ball, the whole illusion shatters, and they\'ll see I\'m just scrambling. Like that feeling I used to get as a kid, trying to make sure mom wasn\'t upset about dad being late again, tidying things, making her tea, trying to be good so the tension would just stop. That connection feels significant. The hypervigilance at work mirroring that childhood role of trying to manage parental emotions to maintain a sense of stability or safety by being good or capable. And the cost both then and now seems to be this feeling of being hollowed out of performing rather than genuinely experiencing or expressing your own needs or limits. Exactly. And it\'s exhausting. Utterly exhausting. After the launch, on Friday night, I just crashed. I had plans to meet up with Chloe and Sam just for a casual drink, but I couldn\'t face it. I canceled last minute, made some vague excuse about feeling unwell, which wasn\'t entirely untrue, I suppose. I felt physically drained. But mostly, I just felt empty and guilty for canceling. Guilty towards Chloe and Sam? Yeah. Because they were looking forward to it. And I know Chloe\'s been having a tough time with her mom\'s health stuff, and I wanted to be there for her. But the thought of having to put on a social face even with close friends, it felt like another performance I just didn\'t have the energy for. So I stayed home, ordered pizza, watched some mindless TV, and ended up opening a bottle of wine. How did that feel? Staying home the wine initially? Relief. Huge relief. Just silence. No demands. No need to anticipate anyone\'s need. S. The pizza was good, greasy comfort food. The first glass of wine, it felt like it loosened something tight in my chest, like I could finally exhale properly. But then, I didn\'t just have one glass. I think I finished most of the bottle, not intentionally really, just topping up while watching this incredibly bland reality show. And then I felt not better, just fuzzy and a bit numb. And the guilt about canceling on Chloe and Sam came back, but sort of muffled, less sharp. And then I woke up Saturday morning feeling dehydrated and groggy and even more annoyed with myself.',
