    'What brings you in today? I\'ve been having really bad lower back pain for about three months now. It\'s not getting better, and it\'s starting to affect my daily life. Can you describe the pain? Where is it located, and does it radiate anywhere? The pain is in my lower back, but it also shoots down my left leg, all the way to my foot. It\'s a sharp, burning pain, and sometimes my leg feels numb or tingly. Does anything make the pain better or worse? Sitting for long periods makes it worse. Standing or walking seems to help a bit, but if I overdo it, the pain gets worse. Lying down flat on my back gives me some relief. Have you had any recent injuries or trauma to your back? Not recently. I did lift something heavy at work about three months ago, and that\'s when the pain started. But I didn\'t think much of it at the time. Have you experienced any weakness in your legs or difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels? No, nothing like that. Just the pain and the numbness in my leg. Do you have any past medical or surgical history? I had a minor knee surgery about ten years ago, but no major back issues before this. Are you currently taking any medications? I\'ve been taking ibuprofen, but it only helps a little. Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you might have a herniated disc in your lower back, which is pressing on a nerve. This is called sciatica. The shooting pain down your leg and the numbness are classic signs. What\'s the next step? We need to confirm the diagnosis with an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will show us if there\'s a disc herniation and how severe it is. Once we have the MRI results, we can discuss treatment options. The MRI is back, and it shows a herniated disc at the L4 L5 level, which is compressing the nerve root on the left side. This explains your symptoms. What does that mean for treatment? There are several options. Most people with a herniated disc improve with conservative treatment, which includes physical therapy, medications, and lifestyle modifications. If that doesn\'t work, we can consider more invasive options like an epidural steroid injection or, in rare cases, surgery. What kind of physical therapy are we talking about? Physical therapy will focus on strengthening your core muscles, improving your flexibility, and teaching you proper body mechanics to avoid further injury. A physical therapist will design a program specifically for you. What about medications? I\'ll prescribe a muscle relaxant and a stronger anti inflammatory medication. If the pain is severe, we can also consider a short course of oral steroids or nerve pain medication like gabapentin. How long will it take to get better? It varies from person to person. Some people see improvement in a few weeks, while others may take a few months. The key is to be consistent with physical therapy and avoid activities that aggravate the pain. What if it doesn\'t get better? If conservative treatment doesn\'t help after a few months, we can discuss an epidural steroid injection. This involves injecting a steroid medication near the affected nerve to reduce inflammation and pain. And if that doesn\'t work? Surgery is the last resort. It\'s only considered if you have severe pain that doesn\'t respond to other treatments, or if you develop neurological symptoms like significant weakness or loss of bladder or bowel control. The surgery would involve removing the part of the disc that\'s pressing on the nerve. Are there risks with surgery? Yes, like any surgery, there are risks, including infection, bleeding, and nerve damage. But for most people, the benefits outweigh the risks if surgery is necessary. I\'d like to try the conservative approach first. That sounds like a good plan. Let\'s start with physical therapy and medications. I\'ll refer you to a physical therapist, and we\'ll follow up in a few weeks to see how you\'re doing. If you develop any new symptoms, like severe weakness or loss of bowel or bladder control, come to the emergency department right away. Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. You\'re welcome. We\'ll get you on the road to recovery.',
    'Physiotherapy Assessment\n\n\nPrimary Diagnosis:\n● L4-L5 disc herniation with left-sided nerve root compression\n● Radiculopathy (sciatica)\n\nTreatment Plan:\n● Physical therapy programme focusing on core strengthening and flexibility\n● Pharmacological management: muscle relaxants, NSAIDs, possible gabapentin for neuropathic pain\n● Lifestyle modifications and ergonomic advice\n● Consider epidural steroid injection if conservative treatment fails\n● Surgical consultation reserved for refractory cases or neurological deterioration\n\nPatient presents with 3-month history of lower back pain following heavy lifting incident at work. Pain described as sharp and burning, radiating from lower back down left leg to foot consistent with L5 nerve root distribution. Associated symptoms include numbness and tingling in left lower extremity. Pain exacerbated by prolonged sitting and excessive activity, partially relieved by lying supine. No reported weakness, bladder or bowel dysfunction. Past medical history includes knee surgery 10 years prior. Currently self-medicating with ibuprofen with minimal relief.\n\nMRI lumbar spine demonstrates L4-L5 disc herniation with compression of left nerve root. Clinical presentation and imaging findings consistent with lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation.\n\nManagement approach includes conservative treatment as first-line therapy. Physical therapy referral for structured exercise programme targeting core stability, lumbar flexibility, and proper body mechanics. Pharmacological intervention includes muscle relaxant and enhanced anti-inflammatory medication. Gabapentin may be considered for neuropathic pain component. Patient education provided regarding activity modification and ergonomic principles. \n\nFollow-up scheduled in several weeks to assess treatment response. Epidural steroid injection discussed as second-line intervention if conservative measures prove inadequate. Surgical referral reserved for cases demonstrating significant neurological compromise (severe weakness, cauda equina symptoms) or failure of conservative and interventional treatments. Patient advised to seek immediate medical attention for development of progressive weakness or sphincter dysfunction. Prognosis generally favourable with conservative management, though individual response varies.',
