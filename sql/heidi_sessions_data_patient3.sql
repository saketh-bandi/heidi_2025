    'What brings you in today? I\'ve got terrible pain in my lower right tooth. It\'s been hurting for a few days now, but it\'s gotten so much worse. I can barely eat or sleep. Can you describe the pain? Is it constant or does it come and go? It\'s constant and throbbing. Sometimes it feels like my whole jaw is aching. And my face on that side is swollen. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like fever or difficulty swallowing? Yeah, I\'ve had a bit of a fever, and it hurts to swallow on that side. Have you had any dental problems in the past? I\'ve had a few cavities filled, but nothing like this. I think I was supposed to get a root canal on that tooth a while ago, but I didn\'t follow up. When was that? About six months ago. Life got busy, and I just didn\'t make it back to the dentist. Are you currently taking any medications? No, I don\'t take anything regularly. I\'ve been using over the counter painkillers, but they\'re not helping much. Do you have any allergies? No allergies that I know of. Let me take a look. Open your mouth as wide as you can. I can see there\'s significant swelling around your lower right molar. The gum is red and inflamed, and there\'s some pus draining from the area. This is a dental abscess, which is an infection around the root of the tooth. Is that serious? It can be if it\'s not treated. The infection can spread to other parts of your jaw or even your bloodstream. We need to take care of this right away. What do we need to do? First, I\'m going to drain the abscess to relieve some of the pressure and pain. Then, I\'ll prescribe antibiotics to help clear the infection. After that, we\'ll need to address the tooth itself. Given the extent of the infection, the best option is likely to extract the tooth. Extract it? Can\'t you save it? Unfortunately, the infection is too advanced. If we don\'t remove the tooth, the abscess could come back, and the infection could spread. I know it\'s not ideal, but it\'s the safest option. Will it hurt? I\'ll numb the area with local anesthesia, so you shouldn\'t feel pain during the procedure. You might feel some pressure, but the pain should be much better once the abscess is drained and the tooth is out. What about after the procedure? You\'ll need to take the antibiotics as prescribed and keep the area clean. I\'ll also give you a prescription for stronger pain medication. You should start feeling better in a day or two. Can I eat normally? Stick to soft foods for the first few days and avoid chewing on that side of your mouth. Avoid hot foods and drinks, and don\'t use a straw, as the suction can dislodge the blood clot and delay healing. How long will it take to heal? The extraction site should start to heal within a week or two. The swelling and pain should improve significantly within the first few days. If you notice any worsening symptoms, like increased swelling, fever, or difficulty breathing or swallowing, come back to the emergency department right away. Will I need a replacement tooth? That\'s something you can discuss with your regular dentist once the area has healed. Options include a dental implant, a bridge, or a partial denture. For now, let\'s focus on treating the infection and getting you out of pain. Okay, let\'s do it. I just want this pain to stop. I understand. Let\'s get started. I\'m going to numb the area now, and then we\'ll drain the abscess and remove the tooth. The procedure went well. I\'ve drained the abscess and extracted the tooth. You should start feeling better soon. Here are your prescriptions for antibiotics and pain medication. Follow the instructions carefully, and make sure to follow up with your dentist in a week or so. Thank you. I already feel a bit better. You\'re welcome. Take care, and don\'t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns.',
    'Dental Clinical Record\n\n\nPrimary Diagnosis:\n● Periapical abscess\n● Infected lower right molar requiring extraction\n\nTreatment Provided:\n● Incision and drainage of dental abscess\n● Extraction of affected tooth (lower right molar)\n● Local anaesthesia administered\n● Antibiotic therapy: Amoxicillin\n● Analgesia: Prescription pain medication\n● Post-extraction care instructions provided\n\nFollow-up:\n● Dental review in 1 week\n● Return immediately if worsening symptoms (increased swelling, fever, dysphagia, dyspnoea)\n● Future prosthetic options to be discussed with regular dentist after healing\n\nPatient presents with severe lower right molar pain for several days with progressive worsening. Associated facial swelling, fever, and odynophagia reported. Patient has history of untreated dental caries with previous recommendation for root canal treatment 6 months prior but failed to attend follow-up. Currently not taking regular medications and reports no known allergies. Over-the-counter analgesia provided inadequate pain relief.\n\nClinical examination demonstrates significant perioral swelling on right side with erythema and fluctuance over lower right molar region. Purulent drainage visible from affected tooth. Clinical presentation consistent with periapical abscess secondary to untreated dental caries with pulpal necrosis.\n\nEmergency dental treatment performed under local anaesthesia. Abscess drained via incision to relieve pressure and facilitate pus evacuation. Affected tooth extracted due to advanced infection and non-viability. Procedure tolerated well without complications. \n\nPost-procedural management includes antibiotic therapy with Amoxicillin to treat residual infection and prevent spread. Prescription analgesia provided for pain control. Patient educated regarding soft diet, oral hygiene maintenance, avoidance of hot liquids and straw use to protect extraction site and promote healing. \n\nFollow-up arranged with dental services in one week for wound assessment and suture removal if required. Patient advised to seek immediate medical attention for warning signs including worsening swelling, persistent fever, difficulty swallowing or breathing suggesting potential deep space infection. Dental prosthetic options including implant, bridge or partial denture discussed as future considerations following complete healing. Prognosis good with appropriate treatment compliance.',
